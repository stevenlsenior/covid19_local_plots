# COVID-19: Local Authority Case Plots

This repo contains code for getting and plotting confirmed cases of COVID-19 by English Local Authority area. The data is drawn from Emma Doughty's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/emmadoughty). This data is being scraped from [PHE's COVID-19 tracker](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/f94c3c90da5b4e9f9a0b19484dd4bb14). There are known data quality issues with this, so plots produced here should be treated with **extreme caution** and used for illustration purposes only.
